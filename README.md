# Customer_Engagement_Insights
In this project, I have tried to analyse Customer Engagement Data for the platform Showwcase.com. This platform enables people in the Tech community to connect with each other and share their projects and skills with everyone on the website. It is a great place to collaborate with people and find potential employment. 
The customers on this platform can log in to their accounts and display their projects and skill set and communicate with other members by liking and commenting on their posts. This project takes into account the user data for each session for the month of October 2019 and tries to find insight about user activity on this platform
